when designing realistic\n          spacescapes, especially when it comes to the sky and atmosphere\n          system, which also was a reason to choose it over Unity. Unreal uses a\n          blueprint system which minimizes code written, this was helpful due to\n          the limited time that could be spent on this project and it also\n          kickstarted the development phase easier.\n        </Col>\n        <Row className=\"page-header2\">Graphics</Row>\n        <Col className=\"page-text\">\n          The graphics for this project was made through <b>Blender</b>, to\n          build and enhance the 3D environment and the game elements, as well as\n          doing texture mapping.

If just\n          touching, the avatar moves slowly, if clicking, the avatar moves\n          faster. With the right hand control, the user can shoot with the\n          gravity gun by pointing the gun towards the item they want to pick up.\n          They can throw and place the items as they like in the 3D space.\n          <b />\n          By these interactions, the user is very free to explore the\n          environment as they wish.

Code\n          sharing was also a challenge, so having to merge all the different\n          parts together that the members had worked with individually also\n          posed some problems.\n          <br />\n          In terms of the user experience, another challenge was that movement\n          wasn't mapped to the users actual movements (such as locomotion) which\n          caused a seasicking feeling. This was however something we had to take\n          a decision on early, due to the limitations in space and resources\n          that we knew we were going to face during demos and presentations. The\n          head movement wasn't also fully mapped to the display view, it seemed\n          to be moving too fast. New challenges would probably appear if we had\n          the opportunity to user test the VR game on kids.\n        </Col>\n        <Row className=\"page-header2\">Lessons learned</Row>\n        <Col className=\"page-text\">\n          Even though it was fun learning a new tool, it got off the project to\n          a slow start where we put a lot of time into learning the tool, which\n          produced a small output.

Secondly, we also wanted to create an educational environment\n          where play and curiosity is key, hence that there is no strict game\n          design prompting the user to do certain things and the game platforms\n          on certain planets shift layout. Lastly, we ourselves wanted to learn\n          more about space and how to design space in 3D environments.\n        </Col>\n        <Row className=\"page-header\">Previous works</Row>\n        <Row className=\"page-header2\">\n          <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5561320\">\n            Aw Kien Sin, and Halimah Badioze Zaman - \"Live Solar System (LSS):\n            Evaluation of an Augmented Reality book-based educational tool.\"\n          </a>\n        </Row>\n        <Col className=\"page-text\">\n          In this paper, the authors explore how the astronomy education book\n          Live Solar System (LSS), enhanced through augumented reality, can be\n          affected by using tangible tools to augment the AR further.
